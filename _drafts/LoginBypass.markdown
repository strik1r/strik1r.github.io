There are many different login pages. There are multiple ways to bypass them. so for the first one:

<h2>Try basic passwords</h2>

So basic yet works so great. But, donâ€™t do it mindlessly. 

<h3>Routers</h3>
People usually does not change the passwords of there routers. We can easily find list of default user passwords for routers.

So how to check the model of the router? First, probably the SSID of the router will be the same as the model number. 

Another trickier way is to check the MAC address. The OUI of the MAC is the first 24bit number (usually the first hexa number) which identifies the vendor or the manufacturer. For example:
00:14:78     TP-LINK TECHNOLOGIES CO.,LTD.

The MAC is really rarely changed so you can get an idea of which type of router  you are up against. You can check the MAC right here:
